          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Alejandro Munoz (although most people call me Alex),
            and I'm an aspiring software developer. I'm currently in my final
            year studying a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at
            UTS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started coding when I was 14 years old, I grew up playing lots of
            video games and always wanted to make my own. So one day I just
            started doing some basic game tutorials using Visual Basic and fell
            in love with programming through that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently looking for work at a company that will give me the
            oppurtunity to grow and develop my skills, I love learning and want
            to really push myself. I'd love to work on creative tech projects
            that involve design and code. I'm looking for Graduate roles!
          </p>
          <h3>Interesting facts about me:</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not programming, I'm either training Parkour, playing
            guitar or trying to develop another one of the various skills I
            have. I have a large list of activities that I enjoy, so much that I
            struggle to find the time for everything. This includes juggling,
            guitar, skateboarding, slacklining, rockclimbing,
            parkour/freerunning and game development.
