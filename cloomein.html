          <p>
            In 2018 I Co-Founded a startup company with two other Senior
            Software Developers, Miguel and Jason, and together we developed an
            app called Cloomein InTouch. The idea behind the app was that it
            allowed businesses to send updates to their clients on the progress
            of the service they were conducting. For example, Domino's Pizza has
            a pizza tracker that tells you when your pizza is being prepared,
            cooked, served, and then delivered. Our app idea was bringing this
            concept to every business and making it extremely affordable.
          </p>
          <p>
            We worked on this for a full year and a half, until approximately
            the end of 2019. By this time we had "pivoted" our startup to aim at
            the tourism industry and put all our efforts into that.
            Unfortunately, just after we had started tackling the tourism
            industry, the Bushfire season started and effectively killed the
            local tourism industry. We then made a decision to make our last
            ditch efforts trying to focus on the international tourism industry.
            Disaster struck once again with Covid-19 forcing countries to stop
            travel and close down.
          </p>
          <p>
            I look back on this startup as a massive learning experience, one
            that I'll never forget. It showed me how little I know, and taught
            me a lot about myself. I'd like to think that one day I'll be able
            to try another startup with all the experience I gained from this
            one.
